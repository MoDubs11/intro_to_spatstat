# intro_to_spatstat

This course provides a (very!) brief, whirlwind introduction to the R package spatstat (Baddeley, Turner & Rubak, http://spatstat.org). Here is the powerpoint and R files of the code). The code presented in the powerpoint should be annotated as you go through the course in the classroom.

This course intends to introduce you to the basics of the package, and how to generate simple but informative outputs to begin to explore your spatial data.
